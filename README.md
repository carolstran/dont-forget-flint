# Don't Forget Flint
A donation platform connecting Flint families with willing water donors.

Users can register as either a donor or a family. When a donation is submitted, a database query is triggered to gather a list of potential recipients and insert one into the donation at random. The match is then revealed to both sides. The goal is to personalize the donation process while avoiding prejudice.

Technologies: React.js, Node.js, Express.js and PostgreSQL.
